Focus on Communication
Understanding a problem and Designing a solution
Don't focus on solutuion and Google is interested to know how you arrived at ypur solution
Google is Collaborative Workplace where Projects are executed by Teams
Be ask questions
should not focus on one problem but dig deeper thorogly to find approach to solution
google's product serve global user Base.Finding Solution is just begining.Solution should be scalable enough to reach a wide audienece,Realiable enough to meets our client's needs and still make efficient use of  our resources




what to keep in mind:
1)How we can tell system is working
2)Is there any bottleneck in system Designing
3)How do the componenets work together
4)how do we provide greate service to everyone
5)Whatever we design how we can fit them into one machine
6)Google may give u large dataset and ask how u can shared it among multiple machines,how we can handle multiple input request,how to indentify fastest machine among pool of Machine, and discard rest of them


System properties:
Latency
Throghput
Storage


keep in mind cost and Latency of various Operations like read from memory,Read from Disk,LAN round-Trip,Cross-Continental Network,



industry Solution Patterns:
Sharding data
Replication  types
Write-Ahead Logging
Separating data and MetaAData Storage
Load Distribution



Tradeoff and Compromises:
Identify Systematic Shorcomings and describe how system repsonde to different system Failures
1)Do u store Data on rotating Disk and pay less money for it=>But this oncrease Latency
2)Do u put Data on Flash Drive=>Drive Data more Quickly but pay more for it


Focus on three things:
Scalable
High Available
Fault Tolerance
